12 January 2014: CSV Translation of ICE Database

After being advised that I was unnecessarily introducing complexity by using JSON for the ICE database, I've switched to editing the CSV directly.  Everything from the ICE summary table is complete.  I will be working on establishing dependencies and filling in the detail data next.
