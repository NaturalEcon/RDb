25 January 2014: Code cleanup, generic views

I am working on converting the old views to generic views, after realizing those exist.  I have ResourceDetailView and ResourceListView done and back to the appearance of the old, handwritten version.  Luckily, I saved the code from the old views, and was able to get the ResourceListView to display the list in lettered bins without any trouble.  I also used GREP to ensure there are no hard-coded absolute paths anywhere in the project, and moved some files around to more proper locations.
