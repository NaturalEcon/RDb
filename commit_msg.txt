9 January 2014: Dataframe integration, managers

Continued debugging model definitions.  Began integrating Pandas dataframe functionality into the application using 'Django-Pandas' by Chrisdev.  The codebase is small, so it was integrated directly into RDb's code, rather than being introduced as a dependency.  It does, however, depend on Manager-Utils.PassThroughManager to work as intended.  Added custom managers to the Survey classes since they cover three possible survey targets (resources, processes, and actors).# On branch master
