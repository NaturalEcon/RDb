3 February 2014: Model splitting, fixture fixing

The models file got far too cumbersome to be left in a monolithic file.  It has been split up into common, base, descriptive, and operational models.  These new model modules have better modularity and inheritance and more standardized field names.  All new classes have already been documented.
