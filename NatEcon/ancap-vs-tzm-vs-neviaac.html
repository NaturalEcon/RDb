On demand production is great, no argument there. But you need a sample calculation of how you would balance the desires of consumers with that design efficiency function. And further, you need to actuually show what that design efficiency function is, not just call it 'f'. This is just a bunch of handwaiving. If you ever want to be taken seriously by people who actually understand economics, you need to get rigorous.﻿

Budgets (individual as well as societal) based on verified sustainability in resource extraction and production of products would be a way to achieve balance. Design efficiency would be in accordance to the goals of those ordering the product or resources which then would vary depending on if the order is based on personal preference (for individual orders) or scientific consensus (for a team of engineers developing a new piece of infra-structure or whatever).﻿

Its simply about dividing verified production capacity and starting to economize.
For example resources and production capacity are divided in two resource banks: 1. societal needs (needs that we share) and 2. personal wants. 1. Are in turn divided into various projects and such, while 2. is divided with the population number. The rest is details.﻿

What is "verified production capacity"?
What is the difference between a societal need and a want?

A verified production capacity would be a direct and more or less real-time measurement of how much the automated industry can produce in a sustainable manner. This would probably include a buffer in case of unexpected industrial malfunctions etc.

A "societal need" (common need) would probably be a fundamental physical or psychological need as it is addressed by the capabilities of society. For example, having roof over your head, access to clean water and basic nutrients, access to medical care to treat any painful or dangerous condition you want to treat etc. Its the more or less universal basic stuff that we share.

Personal wants is tied to your preferences as an individual and not tied to your survival or immediate health. It would deplete your budget more to have your house custom built and with rare materials than if one just got some type of standard. But you would do that if you valued such a house compared to other stuff you could spend your budget on. Perhaps you rather spend lots of it on building better roads for society or on some “public research project” research if you are a researcher and feel you are not sufficiently funded by the public budget.

I imagine basic needs are the ones that would get assigned resources first, as they they would be fundamental for the continuation of the society and its inhabitants. Clarify what you mean by “how do you divide needs between various projects”.﻿

Stop the hand waiving. Describe to me how the production capacity would be verified. I still don't know how I would go to a factory and do so. I could count the number of widgets coming off the production line, but that wouldn't tell me anything in comparison to any other kind of product. And I still wouldn't know whether the production process is creating something people value more than what it is consuming.

Production capacity is measured by data on volumes on output being logged by a transparent computerized system. Exactly how is a technical question I am not equipped to answer. I have not enough competence to give you blue-prints on how to make and install the various equipment needed (element purification, spectral analysis, transportation chains, assembly and fabrication units etc). But as we are talking about physical units (how much there is of that element or material, how fast a specific machine can work and for how long before needing service), they should not be impossible to track like an extensive inventory system and kept in balance, given enough computing power and failsafe mechanisms.

I imagine the manufacturing industry is going to be based on a modular design. A set of machines are created that are easy to service and interface that in turn can interface and create a larger set of machines. And so on from extraction, possessing and assembly to products. We already know what the our basic needs are and what societies need in terms of equipment. From there on its just a question of developing and refining new components to produce new as well as upgrade old products. What if you want a camera? Well then you go through all the different models the industry is capable of producing, you economize the selection of components and features based on what you value and submit the order. Perhaps you even make a new design or modify some features or components if you are have the skill to do so.﻿

Thanks for your well-written and interesting criticisms.  Not even five minutes ago, I just told a friend of mine I should stay away from internet discussions because I haven't read anything useful in weeks.

Analysis of production processes can be done with different metrics depending on the context.  Exergy analysis (EXA) is useful for thermo-economic analysis of a process itself, to view the process as a closed system.  Extended energy accounting, and to an even greater degree, emergy analysis (EMA) is better for viewing the process as an open system, and analysing its impact on the anthro- and biosphere. 

Energy flow is a good way to compare systems and processes with one another, but in light of studies by industrial scientists such as Thomas Graedel and Braden Allenby, we know that material inputs and outputs are an equally important part of the picture.  Material balance accounting is a socialist method which tracks resource inputs and outputs directly, in terms of mass.  We also know now, however, that mass is not the best way to track the resources that are actually available for us to use (allocate) into products.  For this, we want to use the energy required to extract one unit of that resource.  For energy, this is called EROI (energy returned on energy invested) and is already a very ubiquitous analytical tool. 

For nonrenewable resources such as metals, it's called the embodied energy (EE) value or the gross energy requirement (GER).  While output per cycle (tonnes/year) and reserve base (tonnes) seems to be, against common sense, remaining relatively constant for most nonrenewable resources, it has been show that GER has been steadily increasing.  Though we have discovered more deposits and increased our reserve base, the amount of energy required to extract those resources has continually increased, supporting the idea that we should be using them wisely and conservatively.

"And I still wouldn't know whether the production process is creating something people value more than what it is consuming."

Consumptive optimization should be done by the engineers that design the process, without really needing to know whether it's "more valued" by people.  "Value" can be partially determined by direct demand measurements: For consumable resources (which in a PSA society should be kept to a minimum), would be measured as D >= dE/dt, demand is at least the number exploited (used) per cycle.  For non-consumable resources (services, which a PSA society should try to maximize), demand would be measured as D >= ρ, demand is at least the server load (ρ is λ/μ, the number of arrivals per unit time per number of customers that can be serviced per unit time).  This unfortunately only works for ergodic demand, but there are a number of mechanisms to deal with fluctuating demand.

Here's an example of embodied energy calculation: http://naturalecon.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/example-comparison-of-transparent-conductive-materials/

Measuring energy in and energy out does not capture the productive capacity of hardly any process. It would tell you something about a power plant, but it is still missing the 'deliverableness' or 'usefullness' of the energy. For example, let's say that a power plant puts out electrical power at 7 GHz but there isn't any infrastructure to deliver the power at the frequency. Let's say there is another power plant that is less energy efficient but puts out power at 60 Hz and the infrastructure is setup for delivering power at that frequency. Which is more productive?

The mass produced is even more useless. Take machining for example. Machining a bar of metal turns a certain portion of the metal into scrap. Is the scrap just as good as the finished machined part? They both take the same amount to extract but the machined part is (intended to be anyway) more useful and of higher value than the scrap.

What I'm trying to get at is that physical properties have only a tentative relationship to value. And the only way to measure value is with voluntary exchange using money so that every property of a good or service can be put into a common unit.

In your examples you posted there are a massive number of factors all in different units that you have failed to consider. In the transparent semi-conductor example, you didn't take into account: strength, longevity, waste, equipment, land, transportation, refractive index, melting point, etc. The computer use example doesn't take into account: transportation of the computer and/or people, the cost of the time to wait for a computer, the cost of the lack of customization of the computers, etc.﻿

The value of a resource or product of course lies in its utility for the one needing or wanting the resource or product in question relative to other resources or products. The energy is just an objective measure on how much resources are needed in a certain example on how to facilitate useful change.

Of course the physical properties will be known, logged and taken into account when using a resources for a specific purpose.

Money does not measure sustainable production capacity, but a updating budget directly corresponding to sustainable productive capacity does. In some ways it works like money (you spend to get) but in some ways it certainly does not (sustainable productive capacity can not be saved, for example, and if you and I have a wind powered machine that picks apples from a tree on a windy location that are both ours and yields >720 apples per year, we can both have an apple per day without any voluntary exchange - because the apple-picking machine does not need to volunteer to anything). ﻿

"Let's say there is another power plant that is less energy efficient but puts out power at 60 Hz and the infrastructure is setup for delivering power at that frequency. Which is more productive?"

Whichever plant has the higher transformity ratio, which can certainly perform accounting in that example.  If A costs 20MeJ without the infrastructure change, its expected lifetime is 30 years and its expected output is 500MeJ, its initial transformity is 0.04eJ/eJ.  Say B costs 30MeJ, has the same lifetime, and its expected output is 375MeJ, giving it a tranformity of 0.08.  Now, if the additional infrastructure for A costs less than 20MeJ, then A would still have the better transformity ratio, and thus would be the better choice.

"Is the scrap just as good as the finished machined part? They both take the same amount to extract but the machined part is (intended to be anyway) more useful and of higher value than the scrap."

Do we really need a number to tell us which of those is more useful?  I definitely ignore prices entirely when I'm comparing the usefulness of something.  An iPad and a 3D printer both cost $500.  Does that make them equally useful? 

Prices are minorly based on use-value, but the overwhelming component of anything with a significant price, or at least, the floor for all prices actually is its exergy (useful energy) cost.  Because exergy is priced, and must be used to transform raw materials into end-use products at every stage of its lifetime, the lower bound of a price is exactly its exergy cost, in the internal units of the price system.  Pricing things any lower than this is unstable and will result in firm or market failure.  In fact, major market failures in the U.S. happen when GDP growth exceeds energy growth.

"What I'm trying to get at is that physical properties have only a tentative relationship to value."

Only if you believe subjectivity has a non-tentative relationship to value.

"In the transparent semi-conductor example, you didn't take into account: strength, longevity, waste, equipment, land, transportation, refractive index, melting point, etc."

There is no need to account for strength, longevity, refractive index, or melting point for a transparent electrode.  They do not even enter into the function.  I'm not sure what you mean by land, and transportation is largely independent of material type in that example (except for Indium of course which is the material being replaced).  It's funny that you would include waste in that list, because if there's one thing the market is unhilariously bad at, it's properly managing waste and not introducing externalities.

"The computer use example doesn't take into account: transportation of the computer and/or people, the cost of the time to wait for a computer, the cost of the lack of customization of the computers, etc."

That was a decision problem, not an accounting problem, so the criticism is a bit irrelevant.  The latter two are not quantifiable by any system that isn't just making up numbers anyway, and I'm not sure what you mean by 'lack of customization', other than you think that just because there's no ownership system, it means all products must be homogeneous.

Maybe because you're stuck on exchange, you think value systems must include the recipient in its quantification.  However, there receiver systems of value, which is what a price is, and donor systems of value, which is what a gift economy or a natural process operates on.  Natural economics is a donor system of value, which incorporates the maximum power principle and the constructal law.  Rather than restricting demand using starvation via monetary transaction, it restricts supply using a constraint solver in its allocation system. 

Other than that constraint solver, which keeps consumption within the boundaries of what is logistically and ecologically possible, allocation is free and voluntary.  This leaves it up to communities to organize on their own to decide how they want to allocate their productive facilities.  Rather than rewarding ingenious individuals, it rewards ingenious communities who are best able to maximize their resource base into service uptime.  A community can choose to let anyone allocate new products, or it can delegate that role to a special party if it wants.  In this way, the allocation system is free and voluntary, without being unfair and without allowing humans to overstep their bounds.﻿

Value is ENTIRELY SUBJECTIVE. Value is not dependent on the amount of energy it takes to produce something. If I use 100 GJ of energy taking a dump, that dump is only worth the UTILITY someone gets from it. What's the best use for shit?

It is person A voluntarily exchanging X money (whatever that money is) for a good fom person B (also voluntarily) that tells us that person A values the good more than X money. And person B values the good less than X money. If this was not the case, the exchange would not have taken place. You don't need to know how much energy X money required to make or how much energy went into producing the good. All of that is irrelevant to value. It is from this simple idea that we get supply and demand. And it is through this process of exchange that we can objectively measure the subjective value judgements of all of the market participants. With the objective measurements of market participants subjective values, we can objectively determine whether a process is creating or destroying value.

According to your energy theory of value, to produce the most value all we have to do is find the most exothermic thing we can do and do that as much as physically possible. But that isn't going to put food in your belly or a roof over your head. These are things you value, right?

I hope that you can see that with your energy accounting, you have to make all kinds of subjective value judgements to determine which energy is important and which is not. All processes are energy neutral. No energy is created or destroyed. Your accounting relies on your own arbitrary judgements as to which energy form is good and which is bad. How scientific is that?﻿

Do you not agree with that how you value something depends on how well it suits your interests relative to other things? Unless your interest involves everything slowing down towards nothing happening at all, energy is what you need to accomplish that something of value. If you have to spend 100GJ taking a crap and you value continued existence you need to have more than 100GJ energy-reserves and some way to acquire more energy to have the energy to survive and do other stuff. Energy is the reason for things being able to change and processes to continue - which is the foundation for phenomenons of subjective value and so on.﻿

But isn't that a strictly thermodynamic issue?
Based on what we agree upon as a shared platform for society, thermodynamics will determine what kind of energy is important or desired (it will be the kind that is maximizes our agency and ability for action within a sustainable framework). How much energy something requires under given circumstances is not arbitrary. Any preference is subjugated to thermodynamics and thus expressing or pursuing such a preference will be a question of economizing/personal choice according to agreed upon rights to use that energy. Perhaps your preference is to have a house of gold because you think it will impress your neighbors, but that might be too much for the budget you have agreed on to receive as a part of acquiring membership of a sustainable society. ﻿

As I see it, preference is best measured by the one(s) it concern (an individual when it comes to individual preferences for individual solutions, or through a group of individuals coming to an agreement when it comes to issues that are agreed upon as done collectively) by economizing. Does I value A more than B? It means that I am willing to, for example spend more of my budget (in relation to what we have been discussing in this thread it would be a budget of productive capacity) on A than I would like to do on B, and that I would chose A instead of B if I can not have both at the same time.﻿

Usage statistics is pretty general and non-exact though, if applied on individual level. Dangerously close to some notion of law of average IMHO.

While the individual preference of a single person should of course not define joint projects, preference will always be expressed through any action where there are different outcomes with different pros and cons available.

When the day is drawing to a close, you remember that you did not order that birthday cake and that it would really be good if it was delivered tomorrow morning instead of tomorrow noon (lets say the cakes will take some time to manufacture and be delivered).
Thinking about it some more, you would also like to order a bottle of wine, but you can't do both as the cakes ranges from 213 to 558 units and wines 654 to 2350, but you only have a budget of 807 until tomorrow 6:00 am.

Deep Sea Nomad isn't affiliated with me.  My system has nothing to do with credits.  You need to understand what I mean by "donor system of value".  Economizing is not done by the receiver, it's done by the donor.  However, that doesn't mean that there's no way to establish subjective preference, because that's the primary mechanism of allocation.  Loose ordinal sorting is a simple way to resolve conflicts when demand exceeds supply.  It would be trivial for people to form communities with different trophic levels that test different sorting functions.  Yes, you could go off and be your own "community", but you would miss out on the great advantages of living with other people, and the adjacent communities would probably control the proportion of the resources they share with their adjacent communities.  Also, just knowing the amount of emergy you are using compared to others will influence people's behavior.  Not everyone likes to be greedy.

For large projects, qualified and competent individuals will do the work, just like in "voluntary exchange", except the beneficiaries are the people the project actually affects, and not just someone that owned the resources that went into the project.  We already know that voluntary, unpaid individuals are able to create extraordinary products that are far beyond the quality and customization capable of the market due to the open-source movement.

For the other part of the problem solved by money, the budgeting, emergy is more than capable a measure for that.  We can quantify our pressure on the Earth system and keep our economy below that level, but not using money.  It's too simplistic, and allows for far too much substitution, because there's simply no way that prices can accurately reflect physical costs.  It's too easy for prices to exclude negative externalities, and the polycentric law system advocated by ancaps would not adequately fix the serious existential problems our species has coming up, thanks to the market's inability to conserve resources.﻿

In what I suggest, the need for exchange and money IS bypassed when it comes to the necessities of life and most wants (Of course it is directly dependent on how advanced and functional the automated extraction/production/accounting industry is). And that is because "economic exchange" usually refers to the flow of resources between subjects capable of attributing value to the content being transfered. If you and I have agreed on equally sharing the rights to the output of a machine that uses sunlight to scope up sand and spit out silicon sand, there is no exchange. Or if we share a power-plant with others which gives us the right to use a portion of that power to transport and transform that silicon and other elements to a CPU. Sure, there is a flow of resources, but these resources are not money. Its a flow of accounted sustainable productive capacity, it can not be saved or horded as it corresponds to real-time or production cycle-information. If these budgets where agreed upon as individual, as "votes", they would not be transferable between people either.﻿

First, saying that a private exchange based system only benefits the owners of resources is false. Voluntary exchange benefits everyone involved, otherwise those exchanges wouldn't happen. The purpose of the exchange is to get something you value more. So, put that Marxist nonsense out of your head.

Second, prices can absolutely reflect 'physical costs'. This is from the idea of supply and demand. If the supply of something is very limited by nature or it is very costly to make in terms of labor and energy, then the price will be higher in equilibrium. People can make mistakes and have to sell off inventory for less than costs, but that cannot be sustained in a free market. If people don't want to pay what it costs to produce something, then that production will slow down to where the demand clears the supply or production will stop completely.

Third, if the donors to a process are the only ones getting their preferences met, then how do the recievers get their preferences met? Isn't the purpose of an economy to meet the needs/wants of those involved?

Fourth, the open-source community is competing with a fascist market, not a free market. Copywrite and patents are not a part of the free market. You cannot own ideas in someone else's mind. If you have a great idea for a lawn care system, and your neighbor looks over and agrees. Then he implements that idea, it would be an act of agression to go use force to stop him. This is completely incompatible with the free market.﻿

For personal consumption, one would "vote" with ones budget, just like you vote with your dollars if you are American, or gold coin if you live in a society that uses those. The flow of resources signal which solutions are popular and deserve more attention. If there are 100 camera designs available for "on-demand production" the most popular models among those who order cameras will be the ones that will attract the most attention for upgrades in terms of efficiency and functions.

Similarly, if you for example was an engineer working on common/collective projects (receiving a budget not marked for personal consumption, like for example, health care, maintaining the automated industry, education, infra-structure, whatever) and valued furthering your work more than spending resources on personal consumption, you could allocate resources from your personal budget to the budget of your research/engineering team.﻿

Yes, yes, voluntary exchange, very quaint.  In practice, it is not possible to account for all externalities, which affect third parties in an involuntary way.  Clearly energy companies have no problem externalizing the environmental costs of their products in the absence of pigovian taxes.  You yourself just described a positive externality that is not a voluntary exchange: I come up with an idea and my neighbor uses it; He/she benefits, but I certainly do not, and I spent time that I value in order to come up with that idea.

Prices can reflect physical costs, but in your previous post you admitted that they don't.  Profit is value added to the price above the physical cost, which occurs at every stage in a supply chain.  Thus, prices cannot possibly reflect physical costs.  The childish supply/demand theory of prices they teach in econ 101 does not occur in practice.  Businesses always run surpluses without price changing; Businesses also use loss leaders to sell other products.  Furthermore, equilibria do not exist in practice.  Obviously there are infeasible prices for products, but is a very wide range of feasible prices, not one single price.  The demand curve for an individual firm is also not horizontal, as is the presumption when discussing perfect competition.  A store can, in practice, have higher prices than a store down the street without losing sales.  A used car dealership can, in practice, sell you a lemon.  Information asymmetries ensure that these things can occur.

You still aren't grasping the DSV concept.  First, the donors in this case are generally living or nonliving systems, or organizations, not individuals.  Second, they are not "getting their preferences met", because they don't have any.  Third, they are economizing, not deciding, resource allocation.  Communities use cyclic request queues and/or service metrics to express demand for goods (except necessities, which are subject to a different system).  The donor system then fulfills those requests at the end of the cycle.  If the total emergy in the request queue exceeds that of the community's budget, its slack ordinal sorting scheme is used to fulfill as many requests as possible up the budget.  If a person really wants a thing and didn't get it, all they have to do is try again the next cycle.  This ensures that both overexploitation and starvation are constrained.

As for intellectual property not being part of anarcho-capitalism, what is the basis on which firms are supposed to compete?  If it's simply business structure alone, then you are going to be heavily favoring established firms, because supply chain resilience and agility would then determine competitiveness.  Obviously, a new business is going to have a hard time building a supply chain that can compete with a large, established firm. Without intellectual property to protect the entrepeneurs, large, established businesses don't even have to buy out start-ups in order to implement their ideas; They can simply add the product to their line using their superior supply chain and greater capital, and probably offer better fringe benefits like product support and customer networks.  What is supposed to make the market competitive, if not new ideas?﻿

You've made so many errors, I can't possibly address them all in the time I have. Please keep in mind that I am carefully picking my battles.

I think it's really important that you understand the meaning and functon of profits. Profits for a firm happen when they produce things of more value to society than what they consume. Remember the implications of exchange (Calling it quiant is not an argument.), both parties are getting something of more value than they are giving up. That profit allows this value creating activity to continue and encourages it to expand. The profit goes to those who put in the labor and risk to make it happen. Without profit there would be no incentive to take risks and improve. Firms need profit to expand and profit is the economic signal that they should expand.

This idea of "perfect competition" is an arbitrary and impossible standard made up by bad economists. It is completely irrelevant. You're right that equillibrium is never reached in reality, but it is a very real assymptote that the people trend towards until something changes. High profits in an industry encourages competition in that industry. As more competitors enter the market, prices necessarily fall toward some percent above costs. The opposite is true if there are high losses in an industry. This percent above costs is dependent on the interest rates and the money needed for the owners to make a living, etc.

What does it mean if an organization does not have preferences? Even if they do nothing, that means they prefer to do nothing. What's the difference between economizing and deciding? Every decision implies that there is economizing happening. If there was no need to decide one thing over another, then economizing is meaningless.

Intellectual property does not protect entrpreneurs. Are you familiar with the term 'patent troll'? We routinely see large corporations (another creation of the state) shutting out competitors by filling patents, doing nothing with them, and then suing everyone who tries to be productive along the same lines as their patents.﻿

The idea that risks aren't taken without the profit motive is ridiculous. Explain the open source movement.

More competitors does not necessarily equal lower costs with equivalent quality, especially in situations where there are scale or network effects.

Decision and computation are two different things.

You did not address the far more important concern of how entrant firms are supposed to compete against firms in a far more advantageous position due to their size and efficiency.﻿

It comes down to motivation. If we understand profit in terms of how it tied to motivation (which is depending on preference), and broadens it a bit to include other gains than just monetary, why we act as we do becomes a lot clearer.

You mean intrinsic reward. That is true.
Still the reward (which is actually the feeling we get when the good stuff is released in our brains when we do stuff) of intrinsically motivated behavior is dependent on resources and a process with produces surplus of value (what brings us satisfaction must be done in a way that does not consume too much resources relative to other options that too is considered satisfying/valuable).﻿

In a near future, the desires of the consumer may very well just be about clean water, food and a roof over their head. What TZM is suggesting is that we rather share what resources are left than kill eachother over them.

What you are talking about however, is not related to this point of view and in my opinion not even related to reality.

A huge amount of people on this earth cannot be considered consumers due to where they were born.  Consumer<Human.

Reality is that we are human beings and not consumers. 

Reality is that the gluttonous behaviour of todays society will come to an end regardless of the consumers desires.

Yes, there needs to be at the very least a 'proof of concept'. However, as I've explained before, trying to calculated the 'value' created without prices based on voluntary exchange is a meaningless endeavor, and I would wager quite a bit that any proof of concept would fail.

Value, as I've explained before, is a 100% subjective property. And it can only be brought into an objective measurement when it is demonstrated through exchange with a common medium. That way, all the subjective evaluations that people givee to goods and services can be put in a common unit and accounting is possible. These people are talking about doing accounting with physical properties, which completely ignores the actual desires of human beings. (I'm assuming that fulfilling human desires is the purpose of an economy. Crazy, I know.)﻿

What if we create a 'shopping center' where you simply take the goods you need, the computer registers the product leaving the facility and records this. Thereby giving the objective number of how much something is used. Then plugs it into an algorithm to tell the robots to make more of that product from materials that are also harvested and processed by robots. As for the idea of 'voluntary exchange' there is nothing voluntary about a person going, "Hey, you could starve but if you worked for me I'll give you some food or money." That's not voluntary exchange, that's coercion. Same principal applies to a woman who needs money to buy food and a man that wants sex. A money-less society would make such services, such as prostitution that degrade women to an object to be purchased, impossible. Not because its illegal, but because there would be no point. The same principal of removing money, and therefore the profit motive, works for various other services and immoral behavior. Additionally, the inherent properties of currency (money), fiat or otherwise, make it impossible for everyone to have enough money to buy the resources they need to live; the system thrives off of scarcity.﻿

No, structuring all of society so that resources are only distributed by quid pro quo exchange and all resources are assigned ownership (and therefore exclusivity) to someone is a form of coercion.  In fact, I can just say that as "exclusion is coercion".  Enforcing one type of society and then saying that only other types of societies use force is a childish double-standard.

How useful something is to someone in order to achieve a particular purpose (in short: how valuable it is) is of course a subjective experience. But as we have already agreed on, something that has value also consumes a given amount of physically measurable resources in order to come into existence. 

So, with a sustainable limit on consumption and production (which is a holistic perspective that once agreed upon can be scientifically calculated given the current state and capability - as well as the environment in which this economical and industrial is to take place), people will be able to economize and thus assign value to what is being produced. The challenge is of course to design production in a way that is not only sustainable, but allows for a wide range of products, customization and development and thus satisfy high value requirements among the population.﻿

"Under the situation where people can only choose one thing, then you can measure their highest want. Are you advocating a system where people can only choose ONE THING?"

Are you capable of forming arguments that are not straw men?

"It is no coercion to claim ownship of something. To say this is to say there is not such thing as coerciion. If we cannot claim ownership of our bodies, then other people can do whatever they want with them by the definition of ownership. But then there can be no coercion. Your argument is self contradictory."

You can claim self-ownership all you want, nobody here is saying that anyone should be able to do anything they want to you.  However, once again, self-ownership does not automagically imply that all resources should therefore be managed using private property rights.

"You said "...people will be able to economize and thus assign value to what is being produced." But before you can economize, value must be assigned. Also, you didn't explain how values being assigned."

Humans have neurons that are specialized to calculate utility.  Value doesn't have to be quantified for humans to make value-based decisions just like we don't need to understand 100% of the mechanics of a bike to be able to ride one.  Economizing, which means using resources wisely, involves using physical quantities.  Money is completely meaningless without relating it to a physical quantity, like units, kilograms, liters, hours, and so on.  And even then, it is more a proxy for exergy input than it is one for utility.  Sales with low profit margins cannot be said to have strong incentives for innovation for the individual.  They are better made efficient on the large scale.  Sales with high profit margins can just as easily be measured by use and allocation, without the incentive to overproduce.  Budgeting can be done using physical quantities.  Utility, unless you assume that people are inherently irrational, can be measured by demand, whether unitary, massive, volumetric, or temporal.  Disputes over scarce resources, assuming resources are shared, will be actively avoided, and can be resolved using local rules.﻿

Would value not be determined by what economists often call marginal utility?
If you are given a personal budget of resource-allocation rights derived from what has been verified as sustainable production, you can use these allocation rights to allocate resources in the form of products. You would then allocate the resources/products that you would deem most valuable for what you would want to achieve. Of course, if everything produced is crap, they you only have crap to work with, but that is why it is important that not only establish a capability to produce things that lives up to certain standards, but also to design it around modular design and allow people access to knowledge and tools allowing for R&D, - an advanced "open source" environment so that good ideas and solutions can add value.

Regarding self ownership, I think it is problematic to equate the concept of self-sovereignty with the concept of having exclusive control over an object external to your person. Having the right to own/trade a soup can hardly be applied to owning an trading oneself. When you sell your soap you have forever lost the rights to get it back unless the one who now owns it allows you to buy it back or gives it back to you as a gift. This relation can hardly be said to apply to someone who "owns themselves".﻿

I wasn't trying to make a staw man argument. You described a way of comparing people valuation without money. And that was if they could only choose one thing, then we would know their highest want. In order for that to be put into practice, then they would only be able to choose one thing. What am I missing?

Self ownership does imply ownership of other things, unless you start making arbitrary distinctions. If I feed and water my body and it grows, how is that fundamentally different than if I do the same to a plant? If I'm holding on to a tool, that tool is physically attached to me by the same forces that bind my hand to my arm, my arm to my shoulder and so on. What you are doing is making an arbitrary distinction, "These things can be owned and these things cannot." Self ownership also implies a ownership of your actions. If you paint a picture, it would be inconsistent with self ownership for me to say, "Nice job, Thedeepseanomad." In the same way, if you build a tool with what you find in nature it would be inconsistent with self ownership to say, "You don't own that tool, we all do."

You're right that we don't need to quantify value to make value based decisions. However, we need to quantify value to make decisions about other people's values. Making decisions regarding other people's values is necessary for producing things that other people value.

You still have not explained how you connect physical quantities (in a non-arbitrary fashion) to other people's values.﻿

Actually, I described a system of valuation according to physical quantities as they correspond to the actual process that goes into making a resource useful, not according to the arbitrary value that people assign to them based on the very limited knowledge of the world they have. We have quantifiable budgets that we can use on a cyclic basis, and people will find ways to get what they want within their budget. Most people sre not very selfish; only anarch-capitalists are. As for the rest of this question, I have explained it numerous times already. Feel free to actually absorb the information I have given.

You have failed to connect the idea of self-ownership and private property. You actually just shot yourself in the foot by admitting that your body is not a truly closed system with the possibility of distinguishing you from the world. If you build a tool with what you find in nature (which by the way does not happen in civilizations, so great fucking example,) then why do you own it? Nature did most of the work in producing the materials that allowed you to make your quaint device. You probably didn't even come up with the idea for the tool on your own. The person which receives the most benefit from property and profit is generally the one who is best able to unload most of the costs of his/her activity onto others while keeping most of the benefits to him/herself. Supposedly the idea is to benefit others the most, but there is just as much merit in a private property market system to stealthily force your costs onto others without their noticing as there is to provide some sort of perceived benefit (and don't forget that your revered subjective preference principle is based on perceived benefit, which can quite easily be manipulated).﻿

Nice responses, Peter Martinson.

Seriously, people need to understand how economies actually work before they dive in head first to creating "new" paradigms.

I use the quotes because there is really nothing novel about the RBE: it's premises have been used before as the basis for socialist and communist theories. These theories have been put into practice numerous times at different levels, varying from small experimental communities in the 1850s to the USSR of 1921 onwards.

We shouldn't have to debate with people like Peter Joseph ad nauseum about whether or not the principles are well founded: they have been tried and they simply do not work in the real world.﻿

The USSR did not fail because of its lack of free market principles, where did you hear that? Plus, capitalist economies fail all the time, whether under regulation or not.

There are much bigger problems being created by markets, that are now starting to demonstrate their consequences.﻿

In the proposed system I am describing, its different from money as it is information and allocation rights as a direct result of verified, coordinated sustainable production. As such it can not be saved over long periods of time (as it corresponds to verified sustainable production capability which can not be “saved” as it changes over time). This (personal) budget would also be personal/tied to a single person. (There would also be other "puplic" budgets that addresses a basic level of collective needs so that people would not need to worry about that)

This does mean that there is exclusive use rights to resources and products, in some ways very similar to what we usually mean when saying "owning", but some of these allocations might be conditioned, similar to when you lend something – you are free to acquire it and use it as you please, but when you do not need it any more, you return it for others to use or recycling. Of course, it is not unthinkable that one could envision a system where you can also allocate things to “own” instead of just “lending” it – think it would be quite likely that you could do that, but of course, it would be reasonable if it depletes your budget faster if you would do so than if you just “lend” it (having a car on your backyard that you do not want anyone to use without your permission constitutes that resources are withheld from other people in society if compared to temporarily having a car that someone else can take when you are not driving it).

Regarding self-ownership, its not that clear IMHO. How do you define it?
If I look at your examples, I would say nourishing your person and something that is not your person are two different things. The status of the external object also matters (What kind of external object is it? how did you acquire it?) But I agree that having the rights to the fruits of your own labor should be viewed as a fundamental right, but I would derive and motivate such a claim to notions of a right to “self-sovereignty/self determination” rather than self ownership as I do not see it as valid to allow ownership of those who would be willing to sell them selves as slaves (permanently loose their rights of self-sovereignty)in order to avoid what they (the ones becoming slaves) would view as an even greater catastrophe in the moment of signing such a contract.
I think it is quite clear that it is the social relations/contracts of an environment that determines our de facto rights to things. If you make the picture in a context that explains to you that you do not have exclusive use-rights of the paper you paint on, there will probably be some kind of trouble.﻿








Just for fun, total upvotes:
Peter Martinson: 15
The Deep Sea Nomad: 19
Ryan Acumen: 24

Note: All of PM's votes are from the same account.

Commentary by me (+Ryan Acumen):

It's clear that none of the strategies used to explain things to an initiate are going to work for an ancap in the lion's den (and probably vice-versa).  Peter, first of all, assumes outright that "economics" (i.e. the pseudoscientific school of heterodox economic thought that supports anarcho-capitalism or anything like it) requires rigorous explanation of the post-scarcity economy before it can be done (which was never the case with any previous economic system, since they emerged, rather than being designed).  He then requests Deep Sea Nomad to provide a set of equations like a *team of engineers would do*.  However, this is an obvious double-standard and loaded question, since ancaps believe in the economic calculation problem, which claims that no other system besides money can possibly allocate resources [efficiently].

Double-standards are actually the primary basis on which pro-PSA arguments get rejected:
-PSA can't show the specific equations upon which the economy is based
-PSA can't reproduce its calculations
-An uninitiated person could not go to a factory and figure out how efficient it is
-Even if ^, we wouldn't know how 'valuable' the output is (how valuable is a $20,000 car compared to a $60,000 car?  1/3 as valuable?  You sure about that?)
-PSA calculations do not account for every factor (including completely irrelevant ones)
-PSA calculations do not account for all externalities
-PSA accounting relies on arbitrary value judgments
-PSA cannot quantify preference (neither can markets: preference is "quantified" by willingness to give money, but this is not only subject to information asymmetries, it is also skewed by personal wealth.  The state of personal wealth is determined by the previous state, which is again based on willingness to give money and personal wealth.  Unless the initial state of the process put everyone on even footing to accurately determine productivity, it cannot be said to be objective.)
-Allocation does not measure value (then how do sales measure value?)
-PSA is imposing its own subjective preferences onto the world
-PSA is based on coercion
-PSA must connect subjective values to physical measurements

Another very noticeable pattern is that Peter Martinson (and ancaps in general, IME) rejects any and all exceptions to the empirically unsupported premises upon which anarcho-capitalism rests.
"Voluntary exchange benefits everyone involved, otherwise those exchanges wouldn't happen."
There is an innumerable amount of really huge, glaring examples of this being false in reality.  However, pointing these out will never work.
Any exception that cannot be ignored using the voluntary exchange premise will be ignored using the state violence premise.
"The open-source community is competing with a fascist market, not a free market. Copywrite and patents are not a part of the free market. You cannot own ideas in someone else's mind."
Any exception that cannot be ignored using the state violence premise will be ignored using the market equilibrium premise:
"People can make mistakes and have to sell off inventory for less than costs, but that cannot be sustained in a free market."


Anarcho-capitalism is full of logical inconsistencies:
"Second, prices can absolutely reflect 'physical costs'. This is from the idea of supply and demand. If the supply of something is very limited by nature or it is very costly to make in terms of labor and energy, then the price will be higher in equilibrium."

"Value is ENTIRELY SUBJECTIVE. Value is not dependent on the amount of energy it takes to produce something. If I use 100 GJ of energy taking a dump, that dump is only worth the UTILITY someone gets from it. What's the best use for shit?

It is person A voluntarily exchanging X money (whatever that money is) for a good fom person B (also voluntarily) that tells us that person A values the good more than X money. And person B values the good less than X money. If this was not the case, the exchange would not have taken place. You don't need to know how much energy X money required to make or how much energy went into producing the good. All of that is irrelevant to value. It is from this simple idea that we get supply and demand. And it is through this process of exchange that we can objectively measure the subjective value judgements of all of the market participants. With the objective measurements of market participants subjective values, we can objectively determine whether a process is creating or destroying value."

"Value, as I've explained before, is a 100% subjective property. And it can only be brought into an objective measurement when it is demonstrated through exchange with a common medium."

"Self ownership does imply ownership of other things, unless you start making arbitrary distinctions."
"If I feed and water my body and it grows, how is that fundamentally different than if I do the same to a plant?"
"If I'm holding on to a tool, that tool is physically attached to me by the same forces that bind my hand to my arm, my arm to my shoulder and so on."

"Self ownership also implies a ownership of your actions. If you paint a picture, it would be inconsistent with self ownership for me to say, "Nice job, Thedeepseanomad.""
"You cannot own ideas in someone else's mind. If you have a great idea for a lawn care system, and your neighbor looks over and agrees. Then he implements that idea, it would be an act of agression to go use force to stop him. This is completely incompatible with the free market.﻿"

"In the same way, if you build a tool with what you find in nature it would be inconsistent with self ownership to say, "You don't own that tool, we all do.""

And outright false statements:
"Without profit there would be no incentive to take risks and improve."
"High profits in an industry encourages competition in that industry. As more competitors enter the market, prices necessarily fall toward some percent above costs."
"What does it mean if an organization does not have preferences? Even if they do nothing, that means they prefer to do nothing."
"Intellectual property does not protect entrpreneurs."
"If we cannot claim ownership of our bodies, then other people can do whatever they want with them by the definition of ownership."

I'd like to make a final note that despite talking about non-violence, non-aggression, and all that, PM's profile picture is a gun.
